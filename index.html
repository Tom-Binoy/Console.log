    <h1>* Write about Visual Studio and how to set it up
    </h1>
<br>
    <p>
        Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.<br> Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight.<br> It can produce both native code and managed code.

        Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring.<br> The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer.<br> It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git)<br> and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).
        
        Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C,[5] C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#,[6] JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS.<br> Support for other languages such as Python,[7] Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past.<br>
        
        The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge. The slogan for Visual Studio Community edition is "Free, fully-featured IDE for students, open-source and individual developers".
        
        As of November 8, 2021, Visual Studio 2022 is a current production-ready version, and older versions such as 2013 and 2015 are on Extended Support, and 2017 and 2019 on Mainstream Support.[8]

   * Write about console screen. And why it is used.<br> And how to open console screen. Also to print on console screen.
    </h1>
<br>
    <p>
    Console is a tool of programers to check error. And also can print text as well as numbers. </p>
    <br>
    <h1>* How to open Console.log *</h1>
<br>  
    
    <p>To open it first right click on the screen and select "inspect". Now you will see a screen opening near the website. In that screen you will see a menu bar. click console in it. Hurray!!</p><p> You opened Console...<br>
        <br>
      <h1>* How to print on Console.log *</h1>
<br>    
        As I told you earlier we can print on the Console screen. To do so, you need to type the "console.log()" code in JavaScript. For that you need an programers application. You can choose ether Visual Studio or any other application.
